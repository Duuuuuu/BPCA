# BPCA

This is the repository for AM205's final project.

The files in this repository includes:

Python codes:

bpca.py: an implementation of Bayesian PCA
bpca_pymc.py: another implementation of Bayesian PCA using pymc
vis_utils.py: visulization utilities (Hinton graph)
ppca.py: an implementation of probabilistic PCA
ppca_demo.py: a demo for ppca.py
pca_impute.py: a imputer built on top of ppca.py
pca_impute_demo.py: a demo for pca_impute.py
pca_all_impute.py: another imputer that integrated PCA PPCA and BPCA

Jupyter notebooks:
General Test.ipynb: code for experiments section in the final report
plots.ipynb: code for experiments section in the final report
BPCA Test.ipynb: experiments on the behaviour of Bayesian PCA
